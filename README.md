# Anthony Rice - Individual Project

This repository will serve as Anthony Rice's Individual Project for Madison College's Enterprise Java Class.

### Problem Statement

Madison Wisconsin is a hub for a variety of Biotech companies, ranging from the large, multinational corporations to start-up (incubator) companies.

Although some of these companies compile their records and manage their projects using automated computer systems, many of them are still using a paper-based system or programs like Excel to manage their work.

The purpose of this site is to create a web application that will assist with managing projects for tests that needs to be performed for a given sample.

For projects managers, this application will allow them to manage their projects, samples, test methods and more.  Additionally, it will allow them to query data based on certain parameters.  For example, they could search for all tests corresponding to a given project or sample.  Additionally, they could search for all samples that used a given method.

For analysts, this application will allow them to see their worklist with regards to previous, current and upcoming work.  Additionally, they will be able to query to see which test methods they are trained on.
