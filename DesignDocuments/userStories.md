### Create and Edit Projects *
**Project Manager**: I want to be able to create new projects and to edit projects that have already been created.  Projects will include the following information:

- Compound and Drug Phase
- Milestone Dates (Start, Lab Work Complete, Lab Review Complete, Project Complete)
- Testing Directive (Protocol, Email, etc.)
- List of Samples
- Sample Disposition (Optional) (Type: Ship, Dispose, Store, # Days until Disposition, Disposition Directive)

### Create and Edit Samples *
**Project Manager**: I want to be able to create samples and assign them to at least one project.

### Create and Edit Test Methods *
**Project Manager***: I want to be able to create test methods, which can be assigned to samples.  It would also be nice if a method could be owned by a parent (i.e. all, compound A, compound B, etc.).  That way, a confirmation step can be added to make sure that the method and sample are compatible.
