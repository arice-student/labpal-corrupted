# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles.

Note: Both the Time Log and the Weekly Reflection files will be used.  The Time Log will be the primary file, but in instance where additional explaination is needed, the Weekly Reflection file will be used.

### Week 2

23-Jan-2021 - 1.0 hour

**Individual Project**: I am starting to get an idea of what I want to do for my individual project, however, I still have no idea how I am going to implement it.

**Professional Development**: For this, I definitely want to do a Tech Topic, however, I am not sure what I want to do yet.  As of right now, I am leaning toward doing something with JavaFX, however, I know absolutely nothing about it.

When looking things up, I found a LinkIn Learning course called 'Learning JavaFX GUI Development', so I think I may take that since it's only a 2.5 hour course.  I also found some other sites that had some in-depth tutorials.  Here are the links:
* LinkedIn Course: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-javafx-gui-development/welcome?u=74652290
* TutorialsPoint Tutorial: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/javafx_overview.htm
* Jenkov Tutorial: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/javafx/index.html

30-Jan-2021 - 8 to 10+ hours

**Exercise 2**: I struggled mightily with this exercise.  Although I had completed Advanced Java about a month ago, I appeared to have forgotten a lot of that information. However, this exercise helped refresh my memory on a lot of concepts, including Servlets, JSPs, Expression Language (EL), Java Standard Tag Libraries (JSTL), using Dates, learning the order/flow of events, etc.  Some of the links that I used to complete this exercise are listed below:

### Week 3

Learned about log4j and JUnit this week.  Additionally, worked on the Exercise 3 code challenge, which took a lot longer than I had expected.

*Links Used for the Exercise*

* https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2012/03/custom-code-folding-regions-in-intellij-idea-111/

### Week 4

**Professional Development Update**: For the Professional Development, instead of doing a tech topic on JavaFX, I might instead look into Hiberate Search or Hibernate Validator since they may both be needed for the Individual project.

**Individual Project, Check Point #1, Reflection Statement**

- I believe I just finished all the necessary steps for this first check point.  However, to get the application where I want it, I will definitely need to create a lot more wire frames.  In the meantime, there's enough to build the basic framework of the site.
- The issue that I am having is figuring out to design the Project Management web page.  Every time I think I have a solution, I realize that I have no idea how to implement it.  So this will likely require a lot of trial-and-error.
