# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles.

Note: Both the Time Log and the Weekly Reflection files will be used.  The Time Log will be the primary file, but in instance where additional explaination is needed, the Weekly Reflection file will be used.

### Week 1

Week 1 was not included since this file was not created until Week 2.

### Week 2

23-Jan-2021 - 1.0 hour

**Individual Project**: I am starting to get an idea of what I want to do for my individual project, however, I still have no idea how I am going to implement it.

**Professional Development**: For this, I definitely want to do a Tech Topic, however, I am not sure what I want to do yet.  As of right now, I am leaning toward doing something with JavaFX, however, I know absolutely nothing about it.

When looking things up, I found a LinkIn Learning course called 'Learning JavaFX GUI Development', so I think I may take that since it's only a 2.5 hour course.  I also found some other sites that had some in-depth tutorials.  Here are the links:
